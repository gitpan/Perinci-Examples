SYNOPSIS

     use Perinci::Examples qw(delay);
     delay();

DESCRIPTION

    This module and its submodules contain an odd mix of various functions,
    variables, and other code entities, along with their Rinci metadata.
    Mostly used for testing Rinci specification and the various Perinci
    modules.

    Example scripts are put in a separate distribution (see
    Perinci::Examples::Bin) to make dependencies for this distribution
    minimal (e.g. not depending on Perinci::CmdLine) since this example
    module(s) are usually used in the tests of other modules.
